Within the 90 minute hackathon we managed to:
- Propose an idea of creating a sales coach agent that would sit behind a sales call with and attempt to propose strategies to navigate the conversations in real time
- Attempted to enable a dual channel Layercode setup, which we later learned from the owners of Layercode - it's not built for this purpose - but they were eager to prioritise in adding this in
- Fed data to the agent about the client leveraging Linkedin MCP, however this did not have the desired effect as Layercode struggled to make use of the data in their conversation client
- Made use of Layercode's STT/TTS features and LLM output to generate conversation steering tips. We captured these in logs and also by embedding them in the client page itself providing real time options to navigate the conversation.
